        <p>Last Updated: January 4, 2026</p>

        <p>At Lexicon Spell Bee, we are committed to providing a safe and educational environment for students and
            wordsmiths of all ages. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We believe in "Privacy by Design." We do <strong>not</strong> require an email address or personal identity
            to play. We only collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Username:</strong> A name you choose to represent yourself on the leaderboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> Your scores and the levels you play.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
        <p>Your username and score are used exclusively for the Live Leaderboard. This data is stored temporarily in our
            server memory and is not sold or shared with third-party advertisers.</p>

        <h2>3. Children's Privacy (COPPA)</h2>
        <p>Lexicon is an educational tool. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
            Since we do not require registration or personal IDs, we are compliant with the basic principles of COPPA.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>We use external services like DictionaryAPI.dev to provide word definitions. These services do not receive
            any of your individual user data from our app.</p>
